### Description

Hexlet Code is a collection of 5 math-related games designed to challenge and improve your arithmetic skills. The games include:

- Checking if a number is prime
- Inserting a number into an arithmetic progression
- Providing the result of a calculation (multiplication, addition, subtraction)
- Answering if a number is even
- Finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers

### Installation

###To install the games, ensure you have Poetry installed on your machine, then run the following commands:

make install

### Games
### To start playing, you can run the following commands:

### To play "Check if a number is prime":

make brain-prime

### To insert a number into an arithmetic progression:

make brain-progression

### To provide the result of a calculation

make brain-calc

### To answer if a number is even:

make brain-even

### To find the greatest common divisor of two numbers:

make brain-gcd

### After installing the package using pip install --user, all commands can be executed without poetry run (simply brain-calc, not poetry run brain-calc).
